# Buttons

We have pre-designed buttons for you to use on your website. You can use these buttons to link to your social media pages, or to link to your website. You can also use these buttons to link to your email address, or to your phone number.

## Getting Started with Buttons

To get started with buttons, you can import the button component into your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `App.js` file:

```js filename="App.js" copy {1}
import { Button } from "simple-ui-devstuff";
```

You can then use the button component in your project by adding the following line to your `app.js` file:

```js filename="App.js" copy
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "simple-ui-devstuff";

function App() {
  const Click = () => {
    alert("Button clicked");
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Button label="Submit" btnOnClick={Click} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Try out the button component by clicking on the button. You should see an alert pop up on your screen.
